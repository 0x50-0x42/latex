# Commands vs Environments

## Command

* In $\LaTeX$, a command starts with a backslash character followed by the name of the command.
* Example: `\today`, `\pagebreak`, etc.
* Some commands take arguments or parameters which are placed between curly braces.
* Example: `\title{...}`, `\author{...}`, `\section{...}`, etc.
* Some commands take optional arguments which are mentioned in square brackets.

## Environment

* An environment is denoted as: `\begin{...}   \end{...}`
* Example:
```tex
\begin{landscape}


\end{landscape}
```
