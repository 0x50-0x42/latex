# Page orientation, page breaks, set footnotes

## Orientation

* Orientation of a page refers to the direction in which it is displayed.
* Types of orientation:
	* Portrait(default) $\rightarrow$ height $>$ width.
	* Landscape $\rightarrow$ width $>$ height, helpful when we have a table with many columns.
* `geometry` package can be used to change the orientation of the entire document as: `\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}`.
