## Two sided document

* In case of a book, we need to take care of the margins.

In case of a book, this is how the margins are:

* Books have different left and right margins depending on the odd and even page.
* From the image above, we can see that the inner margin for the page on the left, the inner margin is the right margin($2\ cm$) and for the left page, the inner margin is the left margin($2\ cm$).
