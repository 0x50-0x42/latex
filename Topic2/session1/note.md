## Two sided document

* In case of a book, we need to take care of the margins.

In case of a book, this is how the margins are:

<img src="https://github.com/0x50-0x42/latex/blob/LaTeX/Topic2/session1/doubleSidedDoc.png" width="70%" height="70%">

* Books have different left and right margins depending on the odd and even page.
* From the image above, we can see that the inner margin for the page on the left is $2\ cm$ and for the right page, the inner margin is $2\ cm$ as well.
* The left page has its inner margin on the right and right page has its inner margin on the left.
