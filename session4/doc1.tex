	\section{Introduction}
	C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains a widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code(especially in kernels), device drivers and protocol stacks. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.
