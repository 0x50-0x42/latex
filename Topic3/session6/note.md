# Writing mathematics
* Mathematical expressions are written between:
	* `$ ... $`
	* `\[ ... \]`
* For writing complex mathematical expressions, we need to include either `amsmath` or `mathtools`.
* `amsmath` is included in `mathtools`.
* `$ ... $` basically typsets the expression written within it along with the regular text.
* `\[ ... \]` displays the expression written within it in a separate line.

## Fractions
* Fractions are typeset using `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`.

## Variable size of braces
* Sizes:
	* `\Bigg`
	* `\bigg`
	* `\Big`
	* `\big`

## Summation
* Syntax:
	* `\sum_{min}^{max}`
