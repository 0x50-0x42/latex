\begin{document}
	Unlike other \textbf{WYSIWYG editors}, the \emph{content is written in plain text} along with appropriate commands, thus, allowing the user to \underline{concentrate} on the content rather than the aesthetics (the way it looks). The TeX typesetting program which LaTeX uses, was designed such that anyone can create good quality material with less efforts.
