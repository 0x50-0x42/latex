	abstract = {The demo features Partiqle, a SQL engine over key-value stores as a relational alternative for the recent procedural approaches to support OLTP workloads elastically. Based on our microsharding framework [12], it employs a declarative specification, called transaction classes, of constraints applied on the transactions in a workload. We demonstrate use of a transaction class in design and analysis of OLTP workloads. We then demonstrate live-scaling of our fully functioning system on a server cluster.},
