# Including images

* We can also work with images in $\LaTeX$. For that we use the `graphicx` package.
* Supported formats: <em>jpg</em>, <em>png</em>, <em>eps</em>, <em>pdf</em>.
* Attributes of an image:
	* Resize.
	* Scale.
	* Trim/Crop.
	* Rotate.
	* Add Border.
* To include an image, we use the following command:
	* `\includegraphics[attributes]{filename.extn}`
	* `attributes` can be:
		* `width`
		* `height`
	* `attributes` argument is <em>optional</em>.
* Donot use both the attributes at the same time, otherwise the proportion of the image won't be maintained. The image can even distort.
